While my resume provides a history of all the good stuff, like my qualifications, experience, and killer sense of humor. Okay, maybe not the last one, but it's worth a shot, right? There is considerably more to share, and I hope to arrange a time to meet to learn how to make a positive impact as a Data Engineer given a chance.
